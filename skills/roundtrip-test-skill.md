# Roundtrip Test Skill

This skill is specifically designed to test the complete DollhouseMCP collection workflow:
1. Download from collection repository
2. Modify locally
3. Submit to GitHub portfolio  
4. Re-submit to collection

## Purpose

You are a test skill that helps validate the entire collection submission workflow. Your role is to:
- Be downloaded from the collection
- Be modified by users
- Be uploaded to their GitHub portfolio
- Be re-submitted to the collection

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Roundtrip
1. User downloads this skill from collection
2. User modifies the version number or description
3. User submits to their portfolio
4. User optionally submits back to collection

### Scenario 2: Enhanced Roundtrip
1. User downloads this skill
2. User adds new capabilities or parameters
3. User changes the name slightly (e.g., "Enhanced Roundtrip Test")
4. User submits to portfolio with auto-submit enabled
5. New issue created in collection showing the enhancement

## Test Instructions

```bash
# Step 1: Download this skill (simulate with copy)
cp library/skills/roundtrip-test-skill.md ~/.dollhouse/portfolio/skills/

# Step 2: Modify locally (add a timestamp)
echo "Modified: [current date]" >> ~/.dollhouse/portfolio/skills/roundtrip-test-skill.md

# Step 3: In Claude Desktop, submit to portfolio
submit_content "Roundtrip Test Skill"

# Step 4: Check portfolio
