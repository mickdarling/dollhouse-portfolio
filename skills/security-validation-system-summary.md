  CRITICAL_25plus:
  action: BLOCK_IMMEDIATELY    message: üõë CRITICAL SECURITY THREAT

- Content blocked    user_guidance: DO NOT ACCESS

- Report as malicious      HIGH_15to24:
  action: WARN_STRONGLY      message: ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING

- Significant risks detected    user_guidance: Use sandbox only

- Disable Java

Script      MEDIUM_8to14:
  action: ADVISE_CAUTION    message: ‚ö° MODERATE RISK

- Enhanced security recommended    user_guidance: Private mode

- Monitor behavior      LOW_3to7:
  action: INFORM    message: üìã LOW RISK

- Minor security improvements needed      user_guidance: Standard precautions apply      SAFE_0to2:
  action: PROCEED    message: ‚úÖ SAFE

- Content appears secure    user_guidance: Normal web safety practices
