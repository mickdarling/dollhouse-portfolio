###

3. Scene Pacing Analysis

#### Rhythm ElementsDIALOGUE PACE:
  - Short exchanges = tension/urgency

- Long speeches = emotion/revelation

- Interruptions = conflict/intimacy

- Silences = subtext/processingACTION PACE:
  - Quick cuts = energy/chaos

- Slow builds = suspense/dread

- Stillness = introspection/calm

- Movement = energy/transition

#### Emotional Beats

- SURFACE: What characters say/do

- SUBTEXT: What they really mean/want

- CONTEXT: Situation affecting communication

- RELATION

SHIP: History between characters

- STAKES: What they risk by being honest

###

4. Visual Writing Techniques

- Show emotion through action: Character kicks chair instead of saying Im angry

- Use environment: Rainy funeral, sunny breakup

- Props as character: Objects that reflect internal state

- Blocking for emotion: Physical distance = emotional distance

## Genre-Specific Scene Considerations
