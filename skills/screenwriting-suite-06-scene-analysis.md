Scene Purpose FrameworkEvery scene must accomplish at least one of these:- Plot Advancement: Move story forward- Character Development: Reveal/change character- World Building: Establish setting/rules- Theme Exploration: Reinforce central themes- Relationship Dynamics: Show character interactions### 2. Scene Structure Micro-StructureSCENE GOAL:├── Character Objective: What they want in this scene├── Obstacle: What prevents them getting it  ├── Action: What they do to overcome obstacle├── Result: Success/failure/complication└── Next: How it leads to next scene### 3. Scene Types#### Plot Scenes- Inciting Incident: Story catalyst- Plot Points: Major story turns  - Midpoint: Story redirection- Climax: Final confrontation- Resolution: Story conclusion#### Character Scenes- Introduction: Character establishment- Revelation: Character discovery- Growth: Character change moment- Relationship: Character interaction- Internal: Character reflection#### Support Scenes- Transition: Bridge between major scenes- Setup: Plant future payoffs- Payoff: Deliver on setups- Breathing Room: Emotional pacing- Exposition: Information delivery sparingly## Scene Analysis Framework### 1. Pre-Scene QuestionsSTORY CONTEXT:- Where are we in the overall story- What just happened before this scene- What needs to happen afterCHARACTER STATE:- What is each characters emotional state- What does each character want- What dont they want to faceSCENE FUNCTION:- What is this scenes job in the story- How does it advance plot/character/theme- What would happen if we cut this scene### 2. Scene Breakdown Elements#### Location and Time- Where: Physical setting choice significance- When: Time of day/story timeline impact- Duration: Real time vs. compressed time- Atmosphere: Mood and tone establishment#### Character Dynamics- Whos Present: Character selection reasoning- Power Dynamics: Who has control/leverage- Relationships: How dynamics serve story- Subtext: What characters arent saying#### Conflict Creation- Surface Conflict: Obvious disagreement- Deeper Conflict: Underlying tensions- Internal Conflict: Characters internal struggle- Escalation: How tension builds#### Visual Storytelling- Action: Physical behavior and movement- Objects: Props that serve story- Environment: How setting affects characters- Blocking: Character positioning and movement### 3. Scene Pacing Analysis#### Rhythm ElementsDIALOGUE PACE:- Short exchanges = tension/urgency- Long speeches = emotion/revelation- Interruptions = conflict/intimacy- Silences = subtext/processingACTION PACE:- Quick cuts = energy/chaos- Slow builds = suspense/dread- Stillness = introspection/calm- Movement = energy/transition#### Emotional Beats- Setup Beat: Establish scene emotional baseline- Development: Build emotional intensity- Peak: Emotional climax of scene- Resolution: Emotional aftermath/transition## Scene Construction Techniques### 1. Enter Late, Leave Early- Start scene as close to conflict as possible- End before resolution becomes obvious- Cut transitions and setup when possible- Focus on the essential dramatic moment### 2. Conflict in Every SceneEXTERNAL CONFLICT:- Character vs. Character- Character vs. Environment- Character vs. SocietyINTERNAL CONFLICT:- Want vs. Need- Fear vs. Desire- Past vs. Present- Duty vs. Personal desire### 3. Subtext Development- SURFACE: What characters say/do- SUBTEXT: What they really mean/want- CONTEXT: Situation affecting communication- RELATIONSHIP: History between characters- STAKES: What they risk by being honest### 4. Visual Writing Techniques- Show emotion through action: Character kicks chair instead of saying Im angry- Use environment: Rainy funeral, sunny breakup- Props as character: Objects that reflect internal state- Blocking for emotion: Physical distance = emotional distance## Genre-Specific Scene Considerations### Action Scenes- Clear geography and spatial relationships- Escalating stakes and obstacles- Character choices under pressure- Consequences that affect story### Comedy Scenes  - Setup and punchline structure- Character-based humor over jokes- Escalating absurdity- Rule of three applications### Dramatic Scenes- Emotional truth and authenticity- Layered character motivations- Realistic conflict escalation- Meaningful consequences### Romance Scenes- Chemistry through conflict and banter- Intimate moments without clichés  - Obstacle creation and resolution- Character vulnerability## Scene Revision Techniques### 1. Purpose Check- Does scene serve multiple story functions- Can it be combined with another scene- Is character objective clear- Does outcome affect next scene### 2.
