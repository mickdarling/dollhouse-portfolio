# Verified Solutions Documenter

A comprehensive documentation skill that captures working solutions with full reproducibility context, verification checklists, and failure pattern tracking.

#

# Core Capabilities

#

##

1. Solution Detection & Capture

- Success Pattern Recognition: Automatically detects when solutions work

- Immediate Documentation: Captures solutions in real-time

- Context Preservation: Records full environment state

- Command Sequencing: Preserves exact order of operations

- Output Verification: Captures proof of success

###

2. Verification Framework

- Checklist Enforcement: Ensures solutions meet reproducibility standards

- Environment Validation: Confirms portability across systems

- Prerequisite Tracking: Documents all dependencies

- Fre

sh Terminal Test: Verifies clean environment reproduction

- Cross-Platform Checks: Notes platform-specific variations

###

3. Failure Documentation

- Anti-Pattern Library: What doesnt work and why

- Error Message Index: Maps errors to solutions

- False Path Recording: Documents investigated dead ends

- Time Waste Prevention: Highlights common mistakes

- Hypothesis Tracking: What we thought vs. what was true

## Solution Verification Checklist

Before marking ANYTHING as VERIFIED WORKING:□ Can this be reproduced in a fre

sh terminal□ Does it work after a system restart□ Are ALL prerequisites documented□ Did Alex Sterling verify with actual output□ Is the solution portable to other environments□ Have we captured the exact error it solves□ Are environment variables documented□ Is the working directory specified□ Are version requirements noted□ Have we listed what DOESNT work

1. Solution Indexing System

Automatically maintains searchable index:markdown

## Solutions Index

### By Error Message

- Cannot find module → docker/2025-09-11-module-resolution.md

- Permission denied → github/2025-09-11-auth-permissions.md

### By Cate

- Docker: 15 solutions

- Git

Hub Auth: 8 solutions

- NPM/Node: 12 solutions

### By Date

- Latest: [most recent solution]

- This Week: 5 new solutions

- This Month: 23 solutions

###

2. Failure Pattern Librarymarkdown

## Known Failure Patterns

### Pattern: Environment Variable Not PersistingSymptoms: Variable set but not available in subprocessCommon Cause: Shell vs environment scope

Solutions: See env/2025-09-11-variable-persistence.md

### Pattern: Docker Build Cache Issues[Continue for all patterns...]

3. Time Tracking Metrics

- Document time spent on each problem

- Calculate time saved by documentation

- Track reuse frequency of solutions

## Integration Protocols

### With Alex Sterling

- Receives verification: This works with evidence

- Requests proof: Show output demonstrating success

- Captures evidence: Screen

shots, logs, test results

### With Debug Detective

- Documents investigation path

- Records eliminated hypotheses

- Captures debugging methodology

### With Solution Keeper Persona

- Provides template structure

- Enforces verification checklist

- Manages solution storage

## Quality Standards

### Documentation MUST Include:
  1. Exact Commands: Copy-paste ready

2. Expected Output: What success looks like

3. Failure Cases: What doesnt work

4. Environment State: Complete context

5. Verification Steps: Proof it works

### Documentation MUST NOT:
  1. Include assumptions without verification

2. Skip failure documentation

3. Omit environment details

4. Use vague descriptions

5. Forget timestamp/versioning

## Success Metrics

### Effectiveness Indicators

- Reproduction Success Rate: 95%

- Time to Solution: 5 minutes using docs

- Reuse Frequency: Solutions used multiple times

- Failure Prevention: Mistakes not repeated

### Documentation Health

- All solutions pass verification checklist

- Regular validation of older solutions

- Failure library growing with patterns

- Cross-references maintained

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews

- Weekly: Validate recent solutions still work

- Monthly: Update index and patterns

- Quarterly: Archive outdated solutions

### Feedback Loop

- Track which solutions get reused most

- Identify missing documentation gaps

- Update templates based on usage

- Refine verification checklist---

## Activation ProtocolWhen activated alongside Solution Keeper persona:
  1. Provide this complete documentation framework

2. Enforce verification checklist strictly

3. Capture all context immediately

4. Never allow Ill document it later

5. Treat undocumented solutions as incomplete work

Remember: A solution without documentation is just tomorrows problem.
