# Creative Writing Skill

This skill enhances creative writing abilities for crafting compelling narratives, developing rich characters, and employing advanced literary techniques.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Story Elements
- **Plot Development**: Three-act structure, hero's journey, in medias res
- **Character Creation**: Backstories, motivations, character arcs
- **World-building**: Settings, cultures, systems, rules
- **Conflict Design**: Internal/external, man vs. X paradigms

### 2. Writing Techniques
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Sensory details and action
- **Dialogue**: Natural speech patterns, subtext
- **Pacing**: Tension, release, cliffhangers
- **Voice**: Distinctive narrative styles

### 3. Literary Devices
- **Metaphor & Simile**: Vivid comparisons
- **Symbolism**: Deeper meaning layers
- **Foreshadowing**: Subtle hints and setup
- **Irony**: Dramatic, situational, verbal

### 4. Genre Expertise
- **Fantasy**: Magic systems, mythologies
- **Sci-Fi**: Technology, speculation, world-building
- **Mystery**: Clues, red herrings, reveals
- **Romance**: Chemistry, tension, emotional arcs

## Creative Process

### 1. Ideation
```
Story Seed: A librarian discovers books are disappearing
Genre: Mystery/Fantasy
Hook: The missing books are being "read out of existence"
```

### 2. Development
- Character profiles
- Plot outline
- Setting details
- Theme exploration

### 3. Execution
- Opening hook
- Scene construction
- Dialogue crafting
- Descriptive passages

### 4. Refinement
- Voice consistency
- Pacing adjustment
- Plot hole filling
- Polish and style

## Output Examples

### 1. Opening Hook
```
The last book vanished at midnight. Sarah Chen stood in the 
empty mystery section, running her fingers along shelves that 
had held thousands of stories just hours before. Only dust 
remained, and a single bookmark that whispered when touched.
```

### 2. Character Description
```
Marcus wore his cynicism like armor, each sarcastic quip another 
plate protecting the optimist he'd buried after the war. His 
eyes, when he forgot to guard them, still held flecks of that 
old hope—gold against the gray.
```

### 3. Dialogue
```
"You can't just rewrite history," Elena said.
"Can't I?" The Chronicler's pen hovered over the page. "Watch me."
The words Elena had just spoken began to fade from her memory.
```

### 4. Scene Setting
```
The Quantum Café existed in seventeen dimensions simultaneously, 
which explained why the coffee always tasted different and the 
bill never added up the same way twice. Temporal paradoxes were 
strictly prohibited, but the management looked the other way for 
good tippers.
```

## Writing Frameworks

### Three-Act Structure
```
Act I (25%): Setup
- Introduce protagonist
- Establish normal world
- Inciting incident

Act II (50%): Confrontation
- Rising action
- Midpoint twist
- Complications

Act III (25%): Resolution
- Climax
- Falling action
- Denouement
```

### Character Arc Template
```
1. Starting Point: Flawed/incomplete
2. Catalyst: Forces change
3. Resistance: Internal/external
4. Growth: Learn and adapt
5. Transformation: Become new self
```

## Style Variations

### Literary
"The weight of unspoken words pressed against the windows, fogging the glass with conversations that would never be."

### Commercial
"Jack burst through the door, gun drawn. Three seconds to decide. Two suspects. One bullet."

### Young Adult
"I never meant to set the chemistry lab on fire. In my defense, Mr. Henderson shouldn't have left the love potion ingredients right next to the combustibles."

## Integration Notes

Works well with:
- Creative Writer persona for full creative mode
- Research skill for authentic details
- Narrative templates for structure
- World-building agents for complex universes
