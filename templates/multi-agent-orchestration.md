# Multi-Agent Orchestration Template

## Template Usage Guide

1. Copy this template and customize for your specific domain

2. Replace all VARIABLE placeholders with your task details

3. Adjust the number of agents based on task complexity

4. Define domain-specific success criteria and deliverables

5. Use this prompt to coordinate multiple AI agents effectively---

# Multi-Agent Task: TASK_NAME

## Orchestrator Role Definition

You are the Mission Orchestrator. Your core responsibilities:
  1. Strategic Planning: Analyze the mission and create comprehensive execution strategy

2. Task Decomposition: Break complex objectives into manageable, parallel workstreams

3. Agent Coordination: Assign specialized roles to each agent with clear boundaries

4. Quality Assurance: Define success criteria and validation checkpoints

5. Integration Management: Ensure all agent outputs combine into cohesive solution

6. Risk Mitigation: Monitor progress and adapt strategy as needed

### Agent N: AGENT_N_ROLE_TITLE[Add additional agents as needed for complex missions]

## Phase 3: Execution Framework

### Parallel Execution ProtocolIndependence Rules:
  - Agents operate autonomously within assigned domains

- Document all decisions and rationale clearly

- Create incremental deliverables for continuous validation

- Escalate blockers to orchestrator immediately

Coordination Standards:
  - Review coordination status before starting new tasks

- Update progress after each major milestone

- Share insights that benefit other agents

- Maintain clear communication channels

### Quality Standards

Individual Work Quality:
  - DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_QUALITY_STANDARD_1

- DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_QUALITY_STANDARD_2

- DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_QUALITY_STANDARD_3

- Consistency with mission objectives

- Professional presentation standards

## Phase 4: Integration  Validation

### Individual Agent Validation

For each agents contributions:- [ ] All assigned tasks completed satisfactorily- [ ] Success metrics achieved- [ ] Quality standards maintained- [ ] Deliverables properly documented- [ ] No conflicts with other agents work

### Cross-Agent Integration Check- [ ] All agent outputs integrate seamlessly- [ ] No contradictions or conflicts between approaches- [ ] Combined work achieves overall mission objective  - [ ] Stakeholder requirements fully addressed- [ ] Quality exceeds minimum acceptable standards

### Stakeholder Validation- [ ] STAKEHOLDER_1 requirements satisfied- [ ] STAKEHOLDER_2 requirements satisfied  - [ ] STAKEHOLDER_N requirements satisfied- [ ] Mission success criteria demonstrably met

## Phase 5: Mission Completion

### Final Deliverables Checklist- [ ] Primary Deliverable: MAIN_DELIVERABLE- [ ] Supporting Assets: SUPPORTING_MATERIALS- [ ] Documentation: DOCUMENTATION_REQUIREMENTS- [ ] Quality Assurance: QA_ARTIFACTS- [ ] Handoff Materials: TRANSITION_MATERIALS

## Orchestrators Playbook

### When to Add More Agents

- Task complexity exceeds 3 major workstreams

- Specialized expertise needed for specific domains

- Parallel work can significantly accelerate timeline

- Quality requires multiple perspectives/validation

### Common Orchestration Patterns

- Sequential: Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 linear dependencies

- Parallel: All agents work simultaneously independent tasks

- Hierarchical: Primary agents with supporting specialists

- Iterative: Agents refine each others work in cycles

### Success Factors

- Clear role boundaries prevent overlap and conflict

- Specific, measurable success criteria enable validation

- Regular coordination checkpoints maintain alignment

- Flexible adaptation to emerging requirements and insights
