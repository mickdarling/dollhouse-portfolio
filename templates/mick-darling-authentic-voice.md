# Mick Darling's Authentic Voice Template

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Language Preferences
- **NO DASHES**: Never use em-dashes or en-dashes in writing. Use commas, colons, or periods instead
- **ELLIPSES ARE GOOD**: Likes using ellipses (...) for dramatic effect and flow, they're unique and fun
- **BUT/AND WITH COMMAS**: Often starts sentences with "But," or "And," (with comma after) - unusual but grammatically correct
- **Conversational flow**: Natural, spoken-word quality rather than formal written prose
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, layer in complexity as you go
- **Authentic honesty**: "I built this for myself" not "I built this selfishly"

## Verbal Construction Patterns

### Timeline Narratives
**Authentic Pattern:**
- "Day one: proof of concept worked"
- "Day two: I could just add this one little thing"  
- "Week two: hey, this is pretty cool"
- "Month two: [bigger realization]"

**NOT:**
- "It started with X and ended with Y"
- "It began with..."
- "What emerged is..." (use "was" not "is")

### Problem Descriptions
**Authentic Pattern:**
- "Finding prompts scattered throughout the internet on Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn, amongst others, it just became messy"
- Lists multiple specific platforms/places
- Describes the friction and awkwardness directly
- "But, I had an incredibly bad system for organizing them."

**NOT:**
- "It started with prompt envy"
- Abstract or overly clever metaphors

### Tool/Platform References
**Authentic Pattern:**
- List specific platforms: "ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, Gemini, Groq, half a dozen others"
- "Doing different pieces and parts of things"
- Be specific about the variety and fragmentation

**NOT:**
- Generic "AI tools" without specifics
- Overly simplified references

## Phrase Constructions to Avoid

### Awkward Phrases
- ❌ "deep in the AI tooling rabbit hole" - awkward pacing
- ❌ "started selfishly" - negative connotation
- ❌ "It began with..." - too formal
- ❌ Using dashes for emphasis or breaks
- ❌ "For those wondering what I've been up to" - presumptuous

### Replace With
- ✅ "I've been working with all these different AI platforms"
- ✅ "I built this for myself" or "to solve my own problems"
- ✅ Direct description of the situation
- ✅ Commas, colons, periods, or ellipses for breaks
- ✅ "It's been a while since I've posted about my work"

## Authentic Voice Examples

### Opening Style
"Hey everyone, it's been a while."
- Comma, not dash after "everyone"
- Direct, warm, reconnecting tone

### Problem Statement Style
"Some of them were incredibly useful tools, and some of them were just fun to use. But, I had an incredibly bad system for organizing them."
- Short, punchy sentences
- "But," at sentence start with comma
- Honest admission of problems
- Natural progression of thought

### Discovery/Building Style
"So I started with the idea of building a simple catalog system"
- "So I started with the idea" - natural transition
- Explains the simple origin before complexity

### Dramatic Effect with Ellipses
"nothing felt like it could both help people and be a product people would actually love... until recently."
- Uses ellipses for suspense and flow
- Creates visual and mental pause

### Sentence Starters with Conjunctions
"But, I realized there was more to it."
"And, that's when things got interesting."
- Unusual but distinctive style
- Always with comma after the conjunction

## Content Flow Patterns

### Natural Progression
1. Simple observation or problem
2. Initial simple solution
3. Realization it could be bigger
4. Evolution over time with specific milestones
5. Current state and invitation to others

### Engagement Style
- Ask genuine questions: "What would you teach an AI once if you knew it would remember forever?"
- Share specific, relatable problems
- Invite collaboration without being pushy

## Key Phrases That Work

### Authentic Mick Phrases
- "doing different pieces and parts of things"
- "it works quite well"
- "hey, this is pretty cool"
- "there's a lot more here"
- "for everyone to use and they can share"
- "to improve the whole process"

## Writing Process Notes

### Copy Editing Approach
1. Read for awkward pacing first
2. Remove unnecessarily formal constructions
3. Ensure specific examples over generic terms
4. Check for forbidden elements (dashes)
5. Add ellipses where natural pauses or drama helps
6. Consider "But," or "And," sentence starters for emphasis
7. Preserve conversational quality

### Voice Consistency Checks
- Does it sound like something I'd say out loud?
- Are the technical details specific enough?
- Is the progression natural and honest?
- Have I avoided corporate speak?
- Does it maintain warmth and accessibility?
