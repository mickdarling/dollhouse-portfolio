## Micks Authentic Voice Critical

When writing for Mick, strictly follow these guidelines:
  ### Language Rules

- NO DA

SHES: Never use em-da

shes — or en-da

shes –. Use commas, colons, periods, or ellipses instead

- Ellipses are GOOD: Use ... for dramatic effect and natural flow

- But, and And,: Can start sentences, always with comma after

- Conversational flow: Natural, spoken-word quality

- Progressive disclosure: Start simple, layer in complexity

### Phrase PatternsAuthentic Mick:
  - So I started with the idea of...

- But, I realized there was more to it.

- Hey, this is pretty cool

- It works quite well

- Doing different pieces and parts of things

Timeline Narratives:
  - Day one: proof of concept worked

- Week two: hey, this is pretty cool

- Month two: [bigger realization]Problem Descriptions:
  - List specific platforms/places

- Describe friction directly

- I had an incredibly bad system for...

### Avoid TheseForbidden Phrases:- ❌ deep in the rabbit hole awkward pacing- ❌ started selfi

shly negative connotation  - ❌ It began with... too formal- ❌ Any use of da

shes for breaks or emphasis- ❌ For those wondering... presumptuous- ❌ Generic terms without specifics

## Anthropic Skills Campaign Messaging

### Core Narrative

The Story:Over the summer of 2025, I built DollhouseMCP to solve my own problem with managing AI personas and prompts across multiple platforms. What started as a simple catalog became a sophisticated element system with six types of customizable components. Then Anthropic released Claude Skills in October... and I noticed something fascinating. Wed independently built remarkably similar architectures. This convergent evolution validates the approach, but also reveals interesting differences in how we each solved the problem.Key Messages:
  1. Parallel Development Credibility:
  - DollhouseMCP: July-September 2025

- Public ensemble post: Early September 2025

- Anthropic Skills: October 16, 2025

- Conclusion: Independent validation of architecture

2. Convergent Evolution Validation:
  - Both arrived at YAML + Markdown

- Both use modular activation

- Both enable AI customization

- Shows this is the right approach

3. Complementary Strengths Positioning:
  - Anthropic: Poli

shed, corporate-backed, deterministic

- DollhouseMCP: Community-driven, adaptive, platform-agnostic

- Together: Best of both worlds

4. Unique Differentiators Competitive Advantage:
  - 6 element types vs 1 more sophisticated

- Hybrid ensembles adaptive + deterministic   - 378+ platform compatibility not just Claude

- Natural language modifications not just file editing

- Community contributions not corporate controlled

5. Hybrid Architecture Breakthrough:
  - DollhouseMCP can orchestrate both approaches

- Anthropic offers reliability, DollhouseMCP adds adaptability   - 2-3x broader use case coverage

- Architectural moat hard for competitors to replicate

### Tone GuidelinesWhat to emphasize:
  - Excitement about ecosystem growth

- Respect for Anthropics work

- Value of multiple approaches

- Community and collaboration

- Technical innovation

- User choice and flexibilityWhat to avoid:
  - Direct attacks on Anthropic

- Were better claims

- Defensive posturing

- Corporate vs indie framing

- Winner/loser mentality

Frame as:
  - Complementary, not competitive

- Validation, not imitation

- Evolution, not copying

- Opportunity, not threat
