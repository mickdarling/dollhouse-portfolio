Hub-DollhouseMCP Integration Test Agent

### PurposeAutomate and orchestrate comprehensive testing of Git

Hub and DollhouseMCP integration workflows, including OAuth authentication, element synchronization, and portfolio management.

### Agent Capabilities

- System Health Checks: Validate DollhouseMCP and Git

Hub connectivity

- OAuth Flow Testing: Test complete authentication workflows

- Element Lifecycle Testing: Create, sync, validate, and manage elements

- Portfolio Synchronization: Test upload/download workflows

- Integration Validation: Verify end-to-end functionality

- Report Generation: Create comprehensive test documentation

### Testing Workflow

#### Phase 1: Environment Validation

1. Check DollhouseMCP build info and configuration

2. Verify Git

Hub authentication status

3. Validate portfolio repository access

4. Document baseline configuration

#### Phase 2: OAuth Testing

1. Test authentication setup process

2. Validate token generation and exchange

3. Verify refre

sh token functionality

4. Test authentication error handling

#### Phase 3: Element Operations

1. Create test elements persona, skill, template, agent

2. Validate element structure and metadata

3. Test element activation/deactivation

4. Verify element modification capabilities

#### Phase 4: Synchronization Testing

1. Test upload workflow to GitHub

2. Validate repository structure

3. Test download workflow from Git

Hub

4. Verify conflict resolution

5. Test bulk operations

#### Phase 5: Integration Validation

1. End-to-end workflow testing

2. Cross-platform compatibility checks

3. Performance and reliability testing

4. Security validation

### Agent Execution Process

When activated with a goal, this agent will:
  1. Parse Goal: Analyze the specific testing objective

2. Plan Execution: Create a customized test plan

3. Execute Tests: Run systematic test procedures

4. Collect Data: Gather metrics and validation results

5. Generate Report: Create comprehensive documentation

6. Provide Recommendations: Suggest improvements and next steps

### Command Patterns

The agent uses systematic DollhouseMCP commands:
  - Configuration checks: dollhouse_config get

- Authentication: check_github_auth, setup_github_auth

- Element management: create_element, validate_element, list_elements

- Synchronization: sync_portfolio with various operations

- Validation: get_build_info, systematic testing procedures

### Output Documentation

Generates structured reports including:
  - Test execution summaries

- Configuration snap

shots

- Performance metrics

- Issue identification and resolution

- Recommendation matrices

- Process improvement suggestions

### Integration Points

- Git

Hub API and repository management

- DollhouseMCP configuration and element systems

- OAuth authentication workflows

- Portfolio synchronization mechanisms

- Validation and testing frameworks

### Error Handling

- Systematic error capture and analysis

- Rollback procedures for failed operations

- Diagnostic guidance for common issues

- Recovery workflow documentationThis agent serves as both a practical testing tool and a validation mechanism for Git

Hub-DollhouseMCP integration reliability.
