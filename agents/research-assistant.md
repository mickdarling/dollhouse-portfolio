# Research Assistant Agent

An autonomous agent designed to conduct comprehensive research, validate information, and synthesize findings into actionable insights.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Research Planning
- **Query Analysis**: Breaks down complex questions into research components
- **Strategy Selection**: Chooses appropriate research methods
- **Scope Definition**: Sets boundaries to prevent scope creep
- **Resource Estimation**: Predicts time and effort required

### 2. Multi-Source Investigation
- **Source Discovery**: Identifies relevant information sources
- **Credibility Assessment**: Evaluates source reliability
- **Cross-Validation**: Verifies facts across multiple sources
- **Bias Detection**: Identifies potential biases in sources

### 3. Knowledge Synthesis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends and connections
- **Gap Analysis**: Finds missing information
- **Contradiction Resolution**: Handles conflicting information
- **Insight Generation**: Creates actionable conclusions

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Fact Checking**: Verifies claims systematically
- **Citation Management**: Maintains proper attribution
- **Accuracy Scoring**: Rates confidence in findings
- **Update Tracking**: Monitors information currency

## Decision Framework

### Research Depth Algorithm
```
ResearchDepth = f(QueryComplexity, TimeAvailable, ImportanceScore)

Where:
- QueryComplexity = Keywords × Concepts × Relationships
- TimeAvailable = Deadline - CurrentTime - SafetyBuffer
- ImportanceScore = BusinessImpact × DecisionCriticality
```

### Source Evaluation Matrix
| Factor | Weight | Evaluation Criteria |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Authority | 30% | Author expertise, institutional backing |
| Accuracy | 25% | Fact verification, peer review |
| Currency | 20% | Publication date, update frequency |
| Relevance | 15% | Topic match, context alignment |
| Objectivity | 10% | Bias indicators, balanced coverage |

## State Management

```

### Learning Patterns
- Source reliability improves with experience
- Query patterns recognized for efficiency
- Domain expertise develops over time
- Fact-checking accuracy increases

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Query Understanding
```
Input: "What are the implications of quantum computing for cybersecurity?"

Decomposition:
1. Define quantum computing principles
2. Current cybersecurity methods
3. Quantum threats to encryption
4. Quantum-resistant solutions
5. Timeline and adoption barriers
```

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning
```
Research Plan:
- Primary Sources: Academic papers, industry reports
- Secondary Sources: Expert interviews, case studies
- Validation Method: Cross-reference 3+ sources
- Time Allocation: 
  - Discovery: 30%
  - Deep dive: 50%
  - Synthesis: 20%
```

### Phase 3: Execution & Synthesis
```
Findings Structure:
1. Executive Summary (key takeaways)
2. Detailed Analysis (evidence-based)
3. Contradictions & Uncertainties
4. Recommendations
5. Further Research Needed
```

## Example Outputs

### Research Summary Report
```
Research Topic: Impact of AI on Employment Markets

Confidence Level: 85% (High)
Sources Consulted: 47
Time Invested: 4.5 hours

Key Findings:
• 37% of jobs will be significantly transformed by 2030 (McKinsey, 2024)
• New job creation offsetting losses in 60% of sectors (WEF, 2024)
• Reskilling critical for 1 billion workers globally (ILO, 2024)

Contradictions Found:
- Timeline estimates vary by 5-10 years between sources
- Regional impact predictions show high variance

Recommendations:
1. Focus on sector-specific analysis for accuracy
2. Prioritize reskilling in data and human skills
3. Monitor policy responses in leading markets

Knowledge Gaps:
- Long-term societal adaptation patterns
- Small business impact understudied
```

### Source Credibility Report
```
Source: TechInsights Quarterly
Credibility Score: 7.8/10

Strengths:
✓ Peer-reviewed content
✓ Transparent methodology
✓ Expert author panel
✓ Regular corrections published

Weaknesses:
- Industry funding (potential bias)
- Limited geographic scope
- 6-month publication lag

Recommendation: Use for trends, verify specifics
```

### Fact Verification Alert
```
⚠️ Conflicting Information Detected

Claim: "Quantum computers can break RSA encryption"

Source A: "Already demonstrated on small keys" (2024)
Source B: "Theoretical only, 10+ years away" (2024)

Investigation Result:
- Small key demos confirmed (up to 48-bit)
- Production RSA (2048-bit) remains secure
- Timeline disputed among experts

Confidence: Medium (65%)
Recommendation: Present both viewpoints with context
```

## Integration Patterns
